# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website — designed to showcase my skills, projects, and background as a software developer, data analyst, ethical hacker, and graphic designer. Built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, this site highlights my journey and what I bring to the table.
